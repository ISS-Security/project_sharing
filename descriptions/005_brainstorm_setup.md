## Brainstorming and Team setup

### Setup

Please organize the following resources for your team.

Team Google Spreadsheet
- see class website for access to Google spreadsheet of all teams
- add required information for your team

Github Organization
- create a Github organization for your team
- add all teammates to organization
- all repos for this project must be owned by your Github organization

### Brainstorm

Brainstorm ideas for your project with your group. Please add your ideas to our shared Google Spreadsheet for teams.

#### Theme
The *topic* of your service should generally follow these ideas:
- security is its *primary* feature (e.g., secure storage/transfer/communication/etc.)
- should solve some real security problem, or makes a security issue easier to deal with

#### Functionality
The *functionality* of your service should include the following:
- authenticates credentialed users
- securely stores sensitive user data in a database
- securely shares resources between authorized users
- provides ethical terms and conditions of use

#### Examples:
Here are some *examples* from previous semesters:
- File Sharer: users can upload and share confidential files with others
- URL Shortener: users can shorten URLs, track analytics, and share info with others
- Pixel Tracker: users can create a tracking pixel to embed in emails, web pages, etc.
- Secure Messenger: users can chat with others, using encrypted messaging
- Secure Config File Share: developers can store and exchange secure credentials and tokens for projects

#### Novelty
Its fine your idea already exists as a service today, but try to add a *new spin* to it.

Here are some examples of how to modify an existing service idea:
- makes it harder for the service provider (you) to snoop on data (i.e., end-to-end encryption)
- offers automatic transfer of rights (e.g., friends-of-friends-of-friends get automatic authorization to resources)
- offers web + command line access (e.g., file upload/download)
- integrates with modern security tools (e.g., PGP, Keybase)
- adds security trail to identify abuses (e.g., picture watermarks, text manipulations)
- stored resources (e.g., shortened URLs) expire after time
