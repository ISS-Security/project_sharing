# Secure Sessions

This week we will secure the storage of session state across our system and on the client machine.
See the latest version of our demo code:
- [Web application code](https://github.com/ISS-Security/configshare-app/tree/2_secure_sessions)
- [Web API code](https://github.com/ISS-Security/configshare-api/tree/4_authenticate_accounts)

1. Let's update some of the security choices we made last week
  - Let's switch our API to forbid insecure HTTP access â€“ it should only accept HTTPS scheme from requests
  - Try adding tests for the web application's service objects: *stub* any outward HTTP requests to the API
  - If you are using cookies for any non-session purposes, make sure to implement a strong session secret nonce
2. Let's switch our session storage to server-side pool
  - Provision a Redis machine on Heroku
  - Specify Redis as our application's session store
3. Use encrypted session variables
  - Create a secure messaging library for all outgoing messages
    - Create a class in `/lib` that can `encrypt` and `decrypt` any message
    - it should be able to `encrypt` and `decrypt` any message using a secret `MSG_KEY`
  - Create a secure session library
    - Create a class in `/lib` that can securely `set` and `get` session variables
    - Use the NaCl library (`rbnacl/libsodium`) for all cryptography
3. Create a registration workflow that verifies user emails
  - Allow users to create accounts with only username and email
  - Verify the email address by sending an email
    - Use Pony + Sendgrid to send the verification email with a link back to our site
    - Use your secure messaging library to create an encrypted token to embed the new account information in the link
  - Once users return using their verification link, ask for password + password confirmation
  - Create users who have finished the entire process (use a service object)
